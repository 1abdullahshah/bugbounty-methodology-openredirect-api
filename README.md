My bug bounty automation project: testing open redirects &amp; API endpoints with bash + curl

# Starbucks Bug Bounty Methodology ‚Äî Open Redirect & API Testing

**Purpose.**  
This repository documents an educational bug-bounty project where I built automation and testing scripts to explore open redirect behavior and API endpoint handling (500 / 401 responses). The goal is to show methodology, tooling, and lessons learned ‚Äî not to publish or exploit sensitive data.

---

## üîé Summary
- Focus: automation for **open redirect detection** and **API behavior testing** (example endpoints: `/v1/login`, `/v1/me`).
- Key findings (example, responsibly disclosed to Starbucks via HackerOne):  
  - Open Redirect patterns found in `app.starbucks.com` (parameter: `returnUrl`).  
  - `openapi.starbucks.com` returned `500` for malformed login requests and `401` for unauthenticated requests ‚Äî useful for learning input-validation and API-hardening topics.

---

## üìÅ Files in this repo
- `starbucks_poc.txt` ‚Äî example PoC output (curl results; sanitized).  
- `bounty_auto_filtered.sh` ‚Äî filtered automation script (detects 500/401 on `openapi*` and checks redirects).  
- `starbucks_api_test.sh` ‚Äî smaller script to test `/v1/login` and `/v1/me`.  
- `README.md` ‚Äî this file.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to run (local)
> Run these from a safe, authorized environment and only against in-scope targets.

```bash
# make scripts executable (one-time)
chmod +x bounty_auto_filtered.sh starbucks_api_test.sh

# run the main filtered scanner (saves findings to a results file)
./bounty_auto_filtered.sh

# run the single-endpoint tester and capture output
./starbucks_api_test.sh | tee starbucks_poc.txt





-----------------
üß≠ What this demonstrates (skills)

Recon & automation: writing bash scripts to test many endpoints quickly.

Basic API testing using curl and simple payload variation (empty/junk/broken JSON).

How to build repeatable PoC evidence for vulnerability reporting.

Understanding that impact matters: not all findings are bounty-eligible (open redirects often require extra impact to be valid).

‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer ‚Äî Responsible / Educational Use

This repository is for educational purposes only and documents responsible testing performed within the Starbucks HackerOne program scope.

Do not use these scripts against targets you do not have permission to test.
